# Wallet Configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
Crynux is currently in its early stage testnet. All configurations below are subject to significant changes. Please monitor this page for updates and adjust your wallet settings accordingly if you're using a wallet.
{% endhint %}

Currently, the Crynux Network is a testnet Rollapp that is deployed using [Dymension](https://dymension.xyz/). An EVM is running on the Rollapp to support the solidity contracts of Crynux Network.

The base layer token (ETH in the Rollapp) is used as the Crynux Token, which can be treated as the ETH in a standalone Ethereum testnet.

The network parameters are given in the following table:

| Item           | Value                                                                                                         |
