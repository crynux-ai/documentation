# Private Key Security

{% hint style="info" %}
The private key in the node will be protected by a hot/cold wallet separation architecture that is supported by the smart contracts. There will be no funds in the wallet used by the node. No worries about the security of the private key used inside the node. The details will be described later.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Since Crynux will be running on the testnet for the first versions, where the test tokens are used. The private key security is not a critical concern at this moment. The private key protection architecture will be released later.
