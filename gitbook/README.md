### Truly Permissionless

The key component of Crynux is a robust consensus protocol that enables the permissionless joining and using of the decentralized network by millions.

The ability to identify and penalize all malicious behaviors ensures the ecosystem's sustainability while facilitating healthy growth in the long term.

The innovative [vssML](system-design/verifiable-secret-sampling) technology significantly enhances network efficiency, rivaling centralized platforms while remaining decentralized and permissionless.

### Production-Ready AI Services Cloud, on Edge

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the edge nodes, including home computers and mobile devices, who provide hardware to the network in exchange for tokens.

Applications could run tasks such as GPT text generation and Stable Diffusion image generation using various models hosted on the Crynux Network. The integration could be implemented in one-line of code using Crynux SDK.

Model developers use Crynux Network to train/fine-tune their models, and provide models as a service for applications and other developers, earning from the usage of their models.

Mobile devices could also be AI-enhanced by running larger and faster models beyond their current capabilities.

### DeFi Ecosystem built on the Tokenized Model and Data Assets

Building on top of the AI services, an innovative DeFi ecosystem could emerge around "Model Assets" and "Data Assets". All the current DeFi applications could be reimagined using the brand-new assets as their base assets.

For example, the developers of AI models can tokenize the models using Crynux, sharing the rewards from model usage with the model token holders.

Model tokens can be used as collateral in various DeFi applications. These applications can be deployed directly on the Crynux Blockchain or as modular L2 chains that connect to Crynux via cross-chain communication. Existing DeFi applications on other blockchains are also supported.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a completely decentralized and trustless infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.

## Helium Network

Helium Network is the latest testnet of the Crynux Network. Helium Network implements a decentralized AI task execution engine that supports running the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks and the GPT text generation tasks.

Although called a testnet, the featured consensus protocol is robust enough to allow everyone to join at this moment. Everyone has an Nvidia GPU, or Mac with the Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2 and M3 series), could have already joined the network using our node software.

### Stable Diffusion Image Generation

The applications could now send the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks to the network using the inference API, and get the images back instantly.

A showcase application has been developed to demonstrate the abilities. The app provides a web interface (just like [`stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)) for the users to generate images in the browser. Thanks to the Helium Network, the users could use the application on any devices that do not have a capable GPU integrated.

The complexity of the blockchain and tokens are taken care of at the backend using [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge). To the end users, this is just a traditional easy-to-use web application, nothing special.

Give it a try at [https://ig.crynux.ai](https://ig.crynux.ai)

### GPT Text Generation

The applications could also execute the GPT text generation tasks using most of the LLM models on Huggingface, such as [LLaMa 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf), using the inference API of the Helium Network.

A chatbot web application has been developed as an example for the developers. The web application provides a simple chat UI in the browser, and connects to the [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge) at the backend to interact with the Crynux Network.

The chatbot can be accessed at [https://chat.crynux.ai](https://chat.crynux.ai)

## Getting Started

### Start a Node

1. ~~Fill a form to tell us your GPU type, location, network bandwidth~~ \[<mark style="color:blue;">**No application form, no sign up, you donâ€™t need to tell us**</mark>]
2. ~~Join waitlist and wait for the email from us~~ \[<mark style="color:blue;">**No waitlist, just install the Crynux Node app, you can start earning CNX tokens right away**</mark>]
3. Just download the package according to your platform, and follow the tutorials below:
