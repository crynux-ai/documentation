# Start a Node - Linux

The binary releases of the Crynux Node for the Linux distributions are still a work in progress. For now you could simply install Docker and use the Docker image to start Crynux Node on Linux:

{% content-ref url="start-a-node-docker.md" %}
[start-a-node-docker.md](start-a-node-docker.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
