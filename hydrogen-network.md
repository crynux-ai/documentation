# Hydrogen Network

Hydrogen Network is the first testnet of the Crynux Network.&#x20;

## The Decentralized SD Task Execution Engine

## SD Image Generation API for the Applications

## Join the Network Freely by Starting a Node

## Test Blockchain

The Hydrogen Network is running on a private Blockchain whose node can be access using the RPC endpoint:

```url
https://block-node.crynux.ai/rpc
```

The Blockchain is built using the Frontier project, which contains an EVM running on top of the Substrate Blockchain. The Blockchain is Ethereum compatible, most of the existing tools for the Ethereum can be used directly.

The Hydrogen Network is coordinated by three smart contracts on the Blockchain:

```
Token Contract: "0x95E7e7Ed5463Ff482f61585605a0ff278e0E1FFb"
Task Contract: "0xba2489a25A5f542877D3825Ab802651f28878C4a"
Node Contract: "0xB0E9A451Ce0CC181EA9888C7B42BB8Ad90b73C78"
```

The CNX token is just an standard ERC20 token. The tokens will be operated by the other contracts to implement the required functions.

The source code of the smart contracts are open sourced on the GitHub:
