# Task Lifecycle

The task is firstly created on the Blockchain, by the application. The Blockchain dispatches the task to 3 randomly selected nodes. The nodes execute the task, and report the results to the Blockchain. The Blockchain validates the results, if correct, pays tokens to the nodes. After the images are uploaded to the Relay, the task is finished.

The node joins the Hydrogen Network by staking certain amount of tokens. After the staking, the node will be in the candidate list to be selected by the Blockchain.

The following is a sequential graph that illustrates the whole lifecycle of a task.
