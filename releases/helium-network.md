# Helium Network

Helium Network adds the support of the GPT text generation tasks. The Crynux Network now supports running both the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks and the GPT text generation tasks.

Now the applications could use the inference APIs to generate texts with [most of the LLM models on the Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline\_tag=text-generation\&sort=trending). AI Chatbots could have already been built on top of the Crynux Network. To get started, follow the guide:

## GPT Task Framework

A general framework to define and execute the GPT tasks is developed to be used in the Helium Network. A wide range of the common task types and configurations are supported. Just describe the task using JSON, and send it to the inference API:

* Unified task definition for various different large language model
* Apply model specific chat templates to input prompts automatically
* Model quantizing (INT4 or INT8)
* Fine grained control text generation arguments
* ChatGPT style response
