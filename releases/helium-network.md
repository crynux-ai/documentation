# Helium Network

Helium Network adds the support of the GPT text generation tasks. The Crynux Network now supports running both the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks and the GPT text generation tasks.

Now the applications could use the inference APIs to generate texts with [most of the LLM models on the Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline\_tag=text-generation\&sort=trending). AI Chatbots could have already been built on top of the Crynux Network. To get started, follow the guide:
