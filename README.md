# About Crynux

Crynux is an open and democratic AI Infrastructure.

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the decentralized nodes who contribute their spare AI computing power to the network in exchange for token rewards. The computing power is then grouped and dispatched to run the AI tasks from the developers and applications.

On top of the computing network, a decentralized model/dataset hosting service is provided to better support the various AI use cases.&#x20;

The applications could easily connect to the Crynux Network using Inference API, bring AI power to their users with no extra need for the hardware and development.

The developers could write codes to train/fine-tune their models on the dataset provided by the network, using the computing power of the network. The developed model could also be hosted on the network as a service for others.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a fully decentralized and trustworthy infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.&#x20;
