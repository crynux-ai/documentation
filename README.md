# About Crynux

Crynux is an open and democratic AI Infrastructure.

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the decentralized nodes who contribute their spare AI computing power to the network in exchange for token rewards. The computing power is then grouped and dispatched to run the AI tasks from the developers and applications.

On top of the computing network, a decentralized model/dataset hosting service is provided to better support the various AI use cases.&#x20;

The applications could easily connect to the Crynux Network using API, bring AI power to their users with no extra need for the hardware and development.

The developers could write codes to train/fine-tune their models on the dataset provided by the network, using the computing power of the network. The developed model could also be hosted on the network as a service for others.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a completely decentralized and trustworthy infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.&#x20;

## Hydrogen Network

Hydrogen Network is the very first testnet of the Crynux Network. Hydrogen Network implements a decentralized AI task execution engine that supports running the Stable Diffusion image generation task.

Everyone has an Nvidia GPU could have already joined the network by starting a Docker container.&#x20;

And the applications could now send Stable Diffusion image generation tasks to the network using the inference API, and get the images back instantly.

A showcase application has been developed to demonstrate the abilities. The app provides a web interface (just like [`stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)) for the users to generate images in the browser. Thanks to the Hydrogen Network, the users could use the application on any devices that do not have a capable GPU integrated.

The Blockchain and token stuff are handled at the application backend. To the end users, this is just a traditional easy-to-use web application, nothing special.

Give it a try at [https://ig.crynux.ai](https://ig.crynux.ai)

To know more about the Hydrogen Network, start from the [Hydrogen Network introduction](hydrogen-network.md).

To join the network as a node, contributing the local computation power, check the [tutorial on starting the Docker container](node-hosting/join-the-network.md).

To use the inference API, connect your application to the Hydrogen Network, go to the[ application workflow.](application-development/application-workflow.md)
